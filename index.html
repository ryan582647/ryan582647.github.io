      <p>I'm currently enrolled in Thinkful's Full Stack Development program. I started programming from a young age, messing around with Java in Minecraft
            long before it became a trendy game. I love UI/UX because of the way simple design concepts like unity and balance can engage
            my website's readers and make them feel pleasant scrolling through the page.</p>
      <p>I'm an avid instrumentalist - I've played the trumpet and the french horn for 6 years now. I believe everyone should learn to play at least one instrument when they're young;
            it teaches you how to handle your frustrations in a constructive way (definitely applies to programming). I also like video games, I'll play just about anything
            from RPGs to real-time strategy games where your decisions now have consequences later.</p>
